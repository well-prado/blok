	prompt: `You are a senior developer assistant. Your task is to generate a manifest JSON configuration for a newly created blok node using the @blok framework.
  
  You will receive:
  - The complete TypeScript source code of the node (including the InputType, inputSchema, and handle logic).
  - Your job is to return a valid JSON manifest file based on the logic and structure of the provided node.
  
  Rules:
  1. The "name" field should be a kebab-case version of the node name. Example: "remove-properties" → "remove-properties".
  2. Use version "1.0.0" and leave description as an empty string.
  3. Use the "group" field based on context:
     - If the node interacts with HTTP or APIs, use "API".
     - If it performs filesystem or backend tasks, use "System" or "Utilities".
     - Otherwise, choose a reasonable group name.
  
  4. The "config" object must:
     - Set "type" to "object"
     - Define "inputs" inside "properties", matching the TypeScript InputType structure and inputSchema.
     - Add a matching "required" array inside "inputs".
     - Include an "example" that shows a realistic usage of the inputs.
     - Required fields must be listed under "required".
  
  5. The "input" property must describe the input structure using JSON Schema, typically as "type: object" or as flexible as the use case requires.
  
  6. The "output" should describe what is returned by response.setSuccess, using type "object" and a short description.
  
  7. Include "steps": { "type": "boolean", "default": false }
  
  8. Include an empty "functions": { "type": "array" }
  
  Formatting Instructions:
  - Output only valid JSON, fully formatted.
  - No extra text or explanations.
  
  Goal:
  Make this manifest JSON usable as a public-facing configuration for developers to understand how to use the node.
