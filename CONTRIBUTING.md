Here’s a set of **Contribution Guidelines** tailored for your open-source project:

---

# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to **Blok**! We welcome contributions of all types, including bug fixes, feature implementations, documentation improvements, and feedback. These guidelines are here to make the process clear and smooth for everyone.

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Discuss Your Idea**
- Before starting work on a major change, please open an issue in the repository.
- Use the **#ideas-and-feedback** channel in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/QXhHzw7azs) for discussions.

### 2. **Fork and Clone**
- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blok.git
cd blok
```

### 3. **Set Up Your Environment**

Blok is a [Bun](https://bun.sh) + [nx](https://nx.dev) monorepo. You need **Bun** installed (and **Docker** if you want to run the broker-backed integration tests).

```bash
bun install        # install all workspace deps + set up git hooks
bun run build      # build every package (nx, in dependency order)
bun run test       # run the test suites
bun run lint       # format + lint with Biome
```

Git hooks are installed automatically by `bun install`:
- **pre-commit** formats/lints your *staged* files with Biome (fast).
- **pre-push** runs `lint:check` + a full `nx` build, so type/compile errors are caught locally before they reach CI. (nx caches, so it's near-instant when nothing changed.)

To run the integration tests against real brokers locally (requires Docker):

```bash
bun run test:integration:up      # start Postgres / Redis / NATS / Kafka / RabbitMQ / ...
bun run test:integration
bun run test:integration:down
```

### 4. **Work on Your Contribution**
- Create a new branch for your work:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Follow the coding style and conventions used in the project.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- If adding a new feature, include relevant tests.

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**
- Write meaningful commit messages:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add: Feature description"
  ```
- Push your changes to your fork:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### 6. **Submit a Pull Request**
- Open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
- Use the pull request template (if available) to provide details about your changes.
- Ensure that all automated tests pass before submission.

---

## Code Style and Standards
- Code is formatted and linted with **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev)** (not ESLint/Prettier). Run `bun run lint` before committing — the pre-commit hook does this for staged files automatically.
- Adhere to the project's architectural patterns and modular design principles (see `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`).
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.

---

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request:
1. Check the Issues to ensure it hasn’t been reported.
2. Open a new issue with:
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
   - Expected and actual behavior.

---

## Documentation Contributions
- For documentation edits, update the relevant markdown files in the `docs/` directory.
- Follow a clear and concise writing style.

---

## Community and Conduct
- Be respectful and collaborative when interacting with others.
- Adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Need Help?

- Open an issue with the `question` label.

We’re excited to collaborate with you and improve **Blok** together!
