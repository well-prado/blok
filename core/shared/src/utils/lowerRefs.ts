/**
 * lowerRefs — ADR 0001 Option C load-boundary lowering pass.
 *
 * The published/serialized IR carries STRUCTURAL handle references —
 * `{ $ref: { step, path } }` — so the canvas, JSON twin, and AI can derive
 * edges and catch dangling refs WITHOUT executing. The runtime, however, is
 * byte-identical to today: the {@link Mapper} only resolves `js/ctx....`
 * strings and raw `ctx.*` `when` strings. It has no idea what a `{$ref}` is —
 * it walks INTO the plain object and string-resolves the inner `step`/`path`
 * fields, never treating the node as a reference (verified by ADR 0001 probe
 * S1 + the falsification test).
 *
 * This pass bridges the two layers. It runs at the workflow LOAD BOUNDARY,
 * BEFORE the Mapper, and compiles every structural `{$ref}` into EXACTLY the
 * wire string today's engine already resolves. The Mapper stays untouched.
 *
 * Scope (this task — #416): the STEP-INPUTS and TPL positions only.
 *   - step input value: `"js/ctx.state.<root>" + path`
 *   - `path` mapping: string segment → `.seg`, numeric → `[n]`,
 *     empty `path: []` (whole-output ref) → `"js/ctx.state.<root>"`.
 *   - recurses into plain arrays/objects; lowers nested `{$ref}`; leaves
 *     everything else (primitives, class instances, functions) untouched.
 *
 * Out of scope (separate tasks):
 *   - `branch.when` bare-ctx lowering → ADR 0004.
 *
 * Pure + deterministic — never mutates its input. Determinism keeps the
 * idempotency-cache key stable run-to-run (ADR 0001 "hash stability").
